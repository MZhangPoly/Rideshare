This program runs off these assumptions
 1) "Time" is created with ticks. A car moves 1 mile per tick. The simulation is ran for 100 ticks ran 100 times over to remove outliers.
 2) Once a car reaches its destination it immediately re-rolls a new destination station that is not equal to its position and upon the next tick it starts moving towards it

Results for simulation ran for 100 ticks ran 100 times over:

Average revenue for 100 iterations for a road with length: 31, cars: 20, and passengers: 50 revenue: 101.733
Average revenue for 100 iterations for a road with length: 31, cars: 10, and passengers: 40 revenue: 111.951
